## Introduction

This data exploration and visualization project tries to understand the global history from Athens 1986 till 2016 Rio Olympics including women empowerment, shifting power dynamics of nations and society values over the years through Olympics data. We explore the patterns in number of athletes, where they come from, female proportions for different nations and sports over the years. 

We explore these patterns and see how they were affected by the contemporary events, for example how world war events affected the Olympic games. Which countries wins most medals? How different are the characteristics of the athletes for each sport? What are the statistics of both summer and winter Olympic games? We will try to answer these questions through the power of data exploration and visualization.

## Data Source
The dataset we are working on is the Olympic Games dataset that we scraped from http://www.olympedia.org/. It includes all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an athlete competing in a particular Olympic event.
